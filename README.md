## 📚 About The Project

This repository contains the source code for the digital home of Talente Spenden. It serves as a central hub for our members, partners, and anyone interested in our mission to make the world a better place. The website showcases our projects, announces upcoming events, and provides a platform for our community.

A unique feature of this website is its interactive animated gradient background, which is rendered directly on the GPU using custom vertex/fragment shaders with Three.js and React Three Fiber for a smooth and performant visual experience.
The effect is based on a shader provided here:

### 💻 Built With

This project is built with a modern, high-performance tech stack:
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A next-generation frontend tooling.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript.
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - An incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager.
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A 3D graphics library for the web.
* [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) - A React renderer for Three.js.

Since there is currenlty no need for dynamic content management, content (especially lists) mainly is configured in the config file in the /src file. In the future there might be integrations with Content Management Systems.
